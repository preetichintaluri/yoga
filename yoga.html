			Sadhguru: Essentially in the tradition, once we attach the word “Yoga”<br> to anything, it indicates that it is a complete path by itself. The word<br> “Yoga” essentially means, “that which brings you to reality”. Literally,<br> it means “union.” Union means it brings you to the ultimate reality,<br> where individual manifestations of life are surface bubbles in the<br> process of creation.Yoga means to move towards an experiential<br> reality where one knows the ultimate nature of the existence,<br> the way it is made.

	More than a physical workout, yoga is a full mind and body exercise. A set of specific exercises, called poses, combined with specific breathing techniques and meditation principles are the building blocks of a yoga class. The benefits of a regular yoga practice are wide-ranging. In general, a complete yoga workout can help keep your back and joints healthy, improve your overall posture, stretch and strengthen muscles and improve your balance. In addition, yoga’s focus on the breath can calm you and help you learn to be more mindful of your body.
